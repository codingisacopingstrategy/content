This is the wiki repository used by the git-wiki at http://dev.liketightpants.net/

Content should now be more independent of implementation.

This README for example was made via the web interface by naming a page README.

I’m using minad’s fork of git-wiki, which creates a bare git repository on the server.

In this repository I added a post-update hook that pushes to GitHub (which is added as a remote):

#!/bin/sh
git push origin master
