//meta: I would like to somehow make the point that the production of software is starting to be more like the production of other kinds of culture, and that in learning how to deal with culture on the computer, we might learn from software—and possibly vice versa//

Software is culture. It has always been, of course, as a human product. But it is evolving from its roots as tied to specific technological appliances into more pervasive kind of culture, like music or fashion.

Software engineering as a culture has a firm presence on the internet. This is not surprising. The invention of new technologies like web publishing and wikis is closely linked to software engineering; programmers are often early adopters, who conseqeuently seek to codify their vernacular.

> from the closed system to the open form of the fragment (of aphorism or, as Novalis said, of an “endless novel”, which would reflect the events and coincidences of life) and from the categorical attitude of the moralists and master philosophers to intersubjective discourse between friends and those with an affinity of ideas, who seek to mobilise their imagination, provoking each other to react by formulating ideas in an open, fragmentary way.

One of the main uses of the computer is content production. Not just in the sense of 

How little our own computers have to do with this. The operating system, which tended to house user generated documents, is bypassed
